# Example Apps for the Scanbot Web Document Scanner SDK

## What is it?

The [Scanbot Web Document Scanner SDK](https://scanbot.io/en/sdk/web-scanner-sdk/web-document-scanner-sdk) makes it possible
to integrate document scanning on your website or in your web application. It features real-time document detection
with user guidance, auto-snapping, auto-cropping and perspective correction.

## How does it work?

The SDK is a native SDK built for the web via [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).
It relies on [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) and Camera access via HTML Media Capture API.

The react component is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
and the plain JavaScript bundle with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).

## How to run the example apps?

### React App

The React example app relies on the `npm` [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scanbot-web-sdk)
of the Scanbot Web Document Scanner SDK.

To run the React example app:

```
cd react-js/
npm install
npm start
```

### Plain JavaScript App

The vanilla JavaScript app downloads the Scanbot Web SDK from an unofficial CDN:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/scanbot-web-sdk@1.0.0-rc1/bundle/ScanbotSDK.min.js
```

To run the JavaScript example:

```
cd plain-js/
php -S localhost:8000
